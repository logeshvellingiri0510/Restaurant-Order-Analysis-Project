# üçΩÔ∏è Restaurant Sales and Customer Behavior Analysis (SQL Project)

This project focuses on performing an in-depth Data Analysis of a Restaurant's Operations using SQL (MySQL/MariaDB syntax). By analyzing order details and menu information, the project aims to uncover key insights into customer ordering patterns, menu performance, and overall sales trends. This analysis serves as a foundation for making strategic business decisions related to menu optimization, inventory management, and maximizing revenue.
# Project Objectives
The primary objectives for this Restaurant Data Analysis project were:

Menu Performance Assessment: Analyze the existing menu structure to determine the number of items per category, identify the most expensive dishes, and calculate the average price within each category.

Order Pattern Discovery: Investigate customer ordering behavior by identifying the order date range, calculating the total number of orders, and determining which orders contained the highest quantity of items.

Revenue and Spend Analysis: Calculate the total revenue generated by each order and identify the top 5 customers (orders) that resulted in the highest spending.

Item Popularity Analysis: Determine the most and least frequently ordered menu items and their corresponding categories to inform purchasing and marketing strategies.

Data Integration: Demonstrate proficiency in SQL JOINs (specifically LEFT JOIN) to combine transactional data (order_details) with master data (menu_items) for comprehensive analysis.

# Key Features & Insights Derived

The analysis, carried out using the provided SQL queries, yielded the following key components and initial insights:

Menu Structure: The menu contains a total of 23 items, categorized into Main Course, Appetizer, Side, Beverage, and Dessert. The average price varies significantly across categories, with Main Course typically having the highest average price.

Top Items by Price: Identified the most expensive items, such as Steak Frites ($22.00) and Sushi Platter ($25.00), which can be monitored for profitability.

Order Composition: The analysis identified which orders contained more than 2 items, highlighting complex transactions. For instance, Order ID 9 was the largest order by item count (9 items).

Top Spenders: The project successfully calculated and ranked the total spend per order, identifying the Top 5 most valuable orders (Order ID 9 being the highest spender at a total of $98.50).

Popularity Ranking: Determined that items like item IDs 117 and 108 were likely the most frequently ordered items across the recorded transactions, showing strong customer preference for those dishes.
Technical Scope

Tool: SQL (Structured Query Language), demonstrated using MySQL/MariaDB syntax.

Data Source: Two relational tables: order_details (transactional data) and menu_items (menu master data).

Schema Design: Created two tables with appropriate data types and primary keys.

Data Manipulation: Inserted sample data to populate the tables.

Advanced Querying: Used LEFT JOIN for data integration, GROUP BY and COUNT()/SUM()/AVG() for aggregation, ORDER BY for ranking, and HAVING and LIMIT for filtering and restriction.
